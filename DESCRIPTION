Description: This package provides RNetica implementation of Peanut
    interface.This provides an implementation of the Peanut protocol using
    the Netica (RNetica) Bayesian network engine.  This allows parameters
    of parametric Bayesian network models written and Netica and using Peanut to be
    processed with R tools, and the parameter saved in the Netica objects.
