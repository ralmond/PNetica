# PNetica
An implementation of Peanut using RNetica

This provides an implementation of the Peanut protocol using the Netica (RNetica) Bayesian network engine.  This allows parameters of parametric
Bayesian network models written and Netica and using Peanut to be processed with R tools, and the parameter saved in the Netica objects.
