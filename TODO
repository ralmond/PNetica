* Looks like we can't directly make NeticaBN a subclass of PNet.  We
   need to create a wrapper class, which will mean rewriting most of
   PNetica.  [Fixed this by just using "ANY" instead of "PNet" or
   "Pnode" classes.]
* Create a mode for warehouses where they generate an error rather
   than autogenerate a blank network.
